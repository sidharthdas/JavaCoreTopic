# Syncronization:

In Java, the synchronized keyword is used to control access to critical sections of code to ensure that only one thread can execute that code block at a time. There are two common ways to use synchronized:

1. Using synchronized on a method:

```
public synchronized void someMethod() {
    // Critical section
}
This makes the entire method synchronized on the instance of the object on which the method is called. If the method is static, it's synchronized on the class itself.
```
2. Using synchronized block:

```
public void someMethod() {
    synchronized (this) {
        // Critical section
    }
}

In this case, the critical section is enclosed within a synchronized block. The this keyword is used as the monitor object.
```

 3. Now, when it comes to your question about synchronized(Employee.class) vs synchronized(anyObject), let's discuss both:

synchronized(Employee.class):
```
public void someMethod() {
    synchronized (Employee.class) {
        // Critical section
    }
}
This uses the Employee.class as the monitor object. It means that only one thread at a time can execute the critical section for the entire class, not just for a specific instance of the class. It provides class-level synchronization.
```

synchronized(anyObject):

```
public void someMethod() {
    Object lock = new Object();
    synchronized (lock) {
        // Critical section
    }
}
In this case, an arbitrary object (lock) is used as the monitor object. This means that only one thread at a time can execute the critical section for the specified object. It provides a more fine-grained control compared to class-level synchronization.
```
In summary:

synchronized(Employee.class) is class-level synchronization.
synchronized(anyObject) is object-level synchronization, and you can use any object as a monitor.
